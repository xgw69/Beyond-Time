# Minecraft World Generation

Use this skill for biome, dimension, feature, or structure data and their
registration. Use `minecraft-datapack` for non-worldgen data and
`minecraft-modding` for non-worldgen gameplay code.

## Routing Boundaries

- `Use when`: the task changes worldgen data, registration, or injection.
- `Do not use when`: the task is non-worldgen datapack work (`minecraft-datapack`).
- `Do not use when`: the task is non-worldgen mod systems (`minecraft-modding`).

## Choose the delivery path

| Approach | Best When | Platform |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| Datapack JSON | Change data supplied by a pack | Vanilla, any server |
| **Mod + Datagen** | Registering new biomes/dimensions, code-driven | NeoForge / Fabric |
| **Biome Modifier (NeoForge)** | Adding features/spawns to existing biomes | NeoForge |
| **BiomeModification API (Fabric)** | Adding features/spawns to existing biomes | Fabric |

Worldgen registries are datapack registries: their files load at world load and
their registry path determines the data path. Read the [NeoForge registry
guide](https://docs.neoforged.net/docs/concepts/registries/) before choosing a
mod-specific registry path.

## Version boundary

Use Minecraft 26.x for new work. Use Java 25 and start
each JSON schema from the exact target's vanilla data or generated output. Do
not copy a 1.21 shape into a 26.x pack merely because it parses as JSON.

Preserve an established 1.21.x project on Java 21 and its matching schema unless
the task explicitly includes an upgrade. Keep examples matched to the project version.

The [26.1 migration primer](https://docs.neoforged.net/primer/docs/26.1/)
removes `minecraft:random_patch` and `minecraft:no_bonemeal_flower`. It replaces
the random-patch pattern with a separate `minecraft:simple_block` configured
feature and placements for count, random offset, and block-predicate filtering.
Inspect the relevant primer section before migrating code or data.

Read [legacy 1.21 JSON patterns](references/legacy-1.21-worldgen-json.md) only
when the project targets that version. Those examples are not
release artifacts for 26.x.

## Data layout and reference graph

├── dimension/

├── dimension_type/

├── tags/

└── neoforge/
    └── biome_modifier/      (NeoForge mod only)
        └── add_ores.json
```

Build and review the graph from its leaves upward:

1. Define a configured feature, then its placed feature.
2. Reference placed features from a biome or biome modifier at the intended
   decoration step.
3. Define a structure, then its structure set; a jigsaw structure also needs a
   template pool, processor list, and structure template.
4. Define a dimension type and noise settings before a dimension that references
   them.

Use fully qualified identifiers across namespaces. An external `minecraft:` or
dependency reference is valid when that dependency supplies the registry entry;
do not create a local copy merely to satisfy static checking. If the same pack
contains that external namespace and registry directory, treat it as local and
verify the target exists.

---

## Biomes and dimensions

For 26.x biome and dimension data, use the exact target's vanilla data or
datagen output as the schema source. The older `effects` and dimension-type
fields do not model newer environment behavior. The 11 decoration steps still
organize placed features; choose the semantically appropriate step and keep ore
placement in `underground_ores`.

The version-labeled 1.21.5 biome and dimension examples are in
[legacy 1.21 JSON patterns](references/legacy-1.21-worldgen-json.md).

## 26.x feature pattern

For the 26.1 replacement for a simple random patch, the migration primer shows
a `simple_block` configured feature and a placed feature with count, random
offset, and a block-predicate filter. Adapt the exact values and block state to
the target release's generated data.

At `data/<namespace>/worldgen/configured_feature/my_plant.json`:

```json
{
  "type": "minecraft:simple_block",
  "config": {
    "to_place": {
      "type": "minecraft:simple_state_provider",
      "state": { "Name": "minecraft:sweet_berry_bush", "Properties": { "age": "3" } }
    }
  }
}
```

At `data/<namespace>/worldgen/placed_feature/my_plant.json`:

```json
{
  "feature": "<namespace>:my_plant",
  "placement": [
    { "type": "minecraft:count", "count": 96 },
    {
      "type": "minecraft:random_offset",
      "xz_spread": { "type": "minecraft:trapezoid", "min": -7, "max": 7, "plateau": 0 },
      "y_spread": { "type": "minecraft:trapezoid", "min": -3, "max": 3, "plateau": 0 }
    },
    {
      "type": "minecraft:block_predicate_filter",
      "predicate": {
        "type": "minecraft:all_of",
        "predicates": [
          { "type": "minecraft:matching_block_tag", "tag": "minecraft:air" },
          { "type": "minecraft:matching_blocks", "blocks": "minecraft:grass_block", "offset": [0, -1, 0] }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## NeoForge biome modifiers

Biome modifiers load from
`data/<modid>/neoforge/biome_modifier/<path>.json`. They can target a biome id
or tag and add or remove placed features, among other changes. The current
[Biome Modifiers guide](https://docs.neoforged.net/docs/worldgen/biomemodifier/)
documents their schemas, decoration steps, and datagen.

For `neoforge:add_features`, `features` accepts a placed-feature id, list, or
tag. Vanilla placed features may be referenced in biome JSON or added with a
modifier, but NeoForge cautions against doing both because feature-order cycles
can crash world loading. Prefer a copy under the mod namespace when an injected
vanilla feature would create that risk.

When targeting a biome from an optional dependency, put the target in a biome
tag entry with `required: false`, then use that tag in the modifier. This lets
the pack load when the dependency is absent.

---

## Structures and dimensions

For any current release, derive structure, template-pool, dimension, and
dimension-type JSON from that release's vanilla data or datagen output. Confirm
the reference graph before launching a test world:

- `structure_set` references `structure`.
- Jigsaw `start_pool` references `template_pool`; each single-pool element
  references its structure template and processor list.
- `dimension.type` references `dimension_type`; a noise generator's string
  `settings` references `worldgen/noise_settings`.

For Fabric registration or mod datagen, use the exact loader and API version's
documentation rather than copying 1.21 code into a 26.x project.

The detailed 1.21 structure and dimension examples are in
[legacy 1.21 JSON patterns](references/legacy-1.21-worldgen-json.md).

## Development Workflow

1. Create or edit worldgen JSON files in `data/<namespace>/worldgen/` (or equivalent mod resources path).
2. Run the bundled validator to catch JSON and cross-reference errors before loading:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/validate-worldgen-json.sh --root /path/to/datapack-or-mod-resources
   # Strict mode treats warnings as failures:
   ./scripts/validate-worldgen-json.sh --root /path/to/datapack-or-mod-resources --strict
   ```
3. Fix any reported errors and re-validate until clean. The validator checks:
   - JSON validity for `worldgen/**` and `neoforge/biome_modifier/**`
   - Cross-reference integrity for `placed_feature -> configured_feature`
   - Cross-reference integrity for `structure_set -> structure` and biome/biome_modifier feature targets
   - Cross-reference integrity for `jigsaw structure -> start_pool` and `template_pool -> structure template / processor_list`
4. Compare biome and dimension-type JSON against the exact target's vanilla
   registry shape before in-game testing. The helper does not run Mojang codecs:
   valid JSON and local references do not prove that fields such as `carvers`,
   `effects`, or dimension settings match that release's schema.
5. In-game biome and structure testing:
   ```mcfunction
   /locate structure <namespace>:my_structure
   /locate biome <namespace>:my_biome
   /place feature <namespace>:my_ore
   ```
   `place feature` takes a configured-feature ID, not its placed-feature wrapper.
   See Mojang's [place command reference in the 1.19 release notes](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/the-wild-update-out-today-java).
6. For dimension testing, use `/execute in` (dimension must exist at world load, not added via `/reload`):
   ```mcfunction
   execute in <namespace>:my_dimension run tp @s 0 100 0
   ```
7. Check `latest.log` for worldgen errors (missing biome references, malformed noise settings).
8. Note: `/reload` refreshes datapack JSON but does **not** re-generate already-generated chunks. Test new worldgen in a fresh world or newly generated chunks. For existing test worlds, use a disposable copy and a purpose-built chunk reset/regeneration workflow; `/fill` only replaces blocks and is not a substitute for world generation.
